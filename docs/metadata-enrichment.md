# 🧬 Metadata Enrichment in Catalog Systems

Metadata is the connective tissue of the catalog—it powers discovery, filtering, recommendations, and search. Without robust, accurate, and deep metadata, even the largest catalogs become unfindable.

This module focuses on building a **metadata inference and enrichment engine** that scales with catalog growth, adapts through feedback, and empowers downstream systems.

## 1. 🏗️ Foundation: Core Metadata Fields

Start by defining and aligning on critical metadata fields. These vary by category, but typically include:

| Field Type       | Examples                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Structural       | Brand, Category, Subcategory, Pack Size         |
| Descriptive      | Color, Material, Flavor, Scent, Format          |
| Technical        | Model Number, Power (Watts), Screen Size        |
| Regulatory       | Certification, Ingredients, FSSAI Code, Expiry |
| Business         | Sales Rank, Price Band, Availability, Discounts |

> ✅ Clear separation between what defines the product (structural/descriptive) vs. what affects discoverability and strategy (business).

## 2. 🤖 Metadata Inference Engine

Extract metadata from:
- Product titles
- Descriptions
- Images (if supported by vision models)
- Existing catalog correlations

### ✅ Example
- Title: “Cadbury Bournville Dark Chocolate 80g”
- Inferred:
  - Brand = Cadbury
  - Category = Chocolate → Dark Chocolate
  - Pack Size = 80g
  - Flavor = Bournville

### Techniques Used:
- Rule-based parsing (e.g., size after product name → Pack Size)
- Regex pattern libraries tailored per vertical
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) models trained on catalog-specific terms
- Embedding similarity to canonical attribute sets for fuzzy mapping

---

## 3. 🧩 Attribute Standardization

Different sources use different terms for the same attribute. Build a **canonical dictionary** to standardize input and resolve ambiguities.

### ✅ Examples
| Input Term         | Standardized Form            |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| “green tea flavor” | Flavor = Green Tea           |
| “2*200ml”          | Volume = 400ml, Units = 2 x 200ml |
| “bluetooth 5.3”    | Connectivity = Bluetooth v5.3 |

This improves:
- Faceted filtering on PLPs (Product Listing Pages)
- Search indexing and retrieval
- Downstream ML features for recommendations

---

## 4. 🛠️ Manual Overrides & Trust Scores

- Every metadata field is assigned a **confidence score** between 0 and 1.
- Fields below a configured threshold → flagged for review.
- **Manual corrections** (retail/QA teams) are logged as overrides with timestamps and user IDs.
- Overrides are used in:
  - Retraining inference models
  - Building trust scores by source and attribute type

### ✅ Example
- Inferred: Category = Energy Drink (Confidence: 0.58)
- Retail override: “Vitamin Water”
- Outcome: Source mapped lower on reliability; model updated on boundary cases

## 5. 🔁 Feedback Loop Integration

Metadata is upstream of many systems—it must integrate feedback from downstream performance signals:

| Source                | Feedback Signal                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Search                | High bounce rate after filtered query          |
| Recommendations       | Low engagement on specific attribute matches   |
| Retail Ops            | Structured overrides from UI                   |
| QA Audits             | Error sheets indicating repeat misclassification |

Use these signals to:
- Raise alerts on weak attribute types (e.g., scent, size)
- Prioritize retraining or rule refinement

## 6. 📊 Monitoring Metadata Health

| Metric                           | Interpretation                                             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| % Items with Complete Metadata   | Breadth of enrichment coverage                             |
| Avg Confidence per Field         | Quality of inferred data                                   |
| Override Rate                    | Reliance on manual correction vs model performance         |
| Metadata Drift by Source         | Consistency and reliability across ingestion pipelines     |
| Filter Engagement Drop-offs      | Attribute value relevance to users                         |

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                | Mitigation                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overfitting to noisy source terms   | Use source weighting + frequency thresholding              |
| Category-specific ambiguity         | Build tailored rules/models per vertical                   |
| Inconsistent overrides              | Require mandatory notes + audit trail for corrections      |
| Inference lag on emerging formats   | Trigger manual flag + retrain scheduler per anomaly type   |

## ✅ Outcome

An adaptive metadata layer that:
- Powers precise discovery
- Enables intelligent filtering and recos
- Evolves with feedback
- Maintains high integrity even at scale

> “Metadata isn’t decoration—it’s the scaffolding of every smart system built on top of a catalog.”
