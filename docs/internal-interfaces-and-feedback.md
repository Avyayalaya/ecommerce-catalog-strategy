# 🖥️ Internal Interfaces: Empowering Teams with Visibility and Control

Great catalog systems don’t just run—they communicate. Internal interfaces allow retail teams, SLT, QA, and PMs to **observe**, **intervene**, and **learn** from how the catalog evolves. These tools bridge the gap between automated systems and human decision-making.

## 1. 🧩 Purpose of Internal Interfaces

| Audience        | Purpose                                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Retail Teams    | Review matches, submit overrides, track ingestion  |
| SLT             | Monitor coverage KPIs, gap closure, feedback cycles|
| QA/Ops Teams    | Review flagged items, validate corrections         |
| Technical PMs   | Track pipeline health, resolve blockers            |

## 2. 📋 Key Interfaces

### A. Catalog Dashboard
- Ingestion pipeline status (source-wise)
- Daily/weekly velocity
- Top unmatched products by score

### B. Feedback Tracker
- Manual override queue
- Annotation volumes
- Resolution SLAs per team

### C. Match Review Panel
- UI to approve/reject matches (product to existing catalog entity)
- Compare key attributes side-by-side
- Show predicted confidence score (from ML models)

### D. Search & Reco Analytics
- Failed query trends
- Recommendation win/loss analysis
- Click heatmaps and filter engagement

## 3. 🛠️ Interaction Design Principles

| Principle                 | What It Means                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Progressive Disclosure    | Show summary → drilldown only when needed                   |
| Human-in-the-Loop Design  | Interface should complement system predictions, not override blindly |
| Contextual Tracing        | Always show the data lineage and edge scoring rationale     |
| Feedback Impact Loop      | Show how a correction changed model behavior or catalog state|

### ✅ Example
A Retail Ops user overrides the category of `Oat Drink 1L` from `Beverage` → `Dairy Alternatives`. The UI confirms this will:
- Update metadata inference model
- Affect search filter placement
- Boost visibility in vegan tag reco modules

## 4. 🔄 Feedback into System

All inputs are logged and routed:
- As **supervised labels** for retraining ML models
- Into the **audit trail** for compliance and rollbacks
- For **QA validation cycles** in high-error categories

## 5. 📊 Metrics on Interface Effectiveness

| Metric                         | Interpretation                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Override-to-Automation Ratio   | Too high = weak inference, too low = engagement drop     |
| Feedback Cycle Closure Time    | Avg time to resolve and apply corrections                |
| Interface Adoption             | Weekly/monthly active users per module                   |
| Post-Feedback Model Accuracy   | Learning effectiveness from human input                  |

---

## ✅ Outcome

Internal interfaces ensure:
- High-confidence automation with human governance
- Learning loops that get smarter with every click
- Team-level empowerment without over-reliance on eng/ML
