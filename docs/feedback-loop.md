# 🔁 Feedback Loops in Catalog Systems

Feedback is the critical flywheel that powers **catalog precision**, **system evolution**, and **user trust**. A great catalog isn’t static—it learns from friction. Every human correction, failure to convert, or unexpected outcome is a signal to improve the system.

## 1. 🧭 Types of Feedback

| Source             | Format                      | Example                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retail Team Input | UI-based annotation         | “This is a duplicate”, “Incorrect spec”, “Brand override: ‘Tata’ not ‘TATA’” |
| User Behavior      | Implicit logs               | Click without add-to-cart, add-to-cart but no purchase, bounce from page |
| Manual QA          | Structured correction sheets| Missing image, wrong category, invalid MRP                              |
| SLT/Business Input | Prioritized issue lists     | “Top 100 SKUs not searchable”                                          |

## 2. 📥 Feedback Capture Interfaces

- **Retail Ops Interface**: Annotate SKUs, approve/reject matches, add comments
- **QA Panel**: Batch review from flagged SKUs (auto-triggered or manual)
- **Feedback Inbox**: Route SLT and business reports via tagging into issue queues

### ✅ Example: Retail Flow
- Query: `Amul Dark Chocolate 150g`
- Retail team sees variant mapped to a sugar-free version
- Flags: "Incorrect spec"
- Adds note: "This is not sugar-free; packaging variant confusion"
- System updates matching logic → reduces spec weight for similar products

### ✅ Example: User Behavior
- User searches: `Herbal shampoo for dandruff`
- Clicks on top result → bounces in <3 seconds
- Add-to-cart rate: 0%
- System flags query-product pair as low engagement → reviews alternate matches or metadata issues

---

## 3. 🔄 Integration into Systems

### A. Matching System
- Adjust weights for features where errors occurred (e.g., reduce weight on color for clothing if false positives are common)
- Include manual corrections as supervised labels for future training

### B. Metadata Inference
- Feedback helps validate or override inferred metadata
- Update field confidence scores (e.g., “95% sure it’s under 'Organic Foods' → corrected to 'Snacks'” → score adjusted)

### C. Search & Reco Loops
- Feed corrections into query understanding and synonym logic
- Penalize over-suggested or irrelevant recos based on feedback

---

## 4. 🧠 Feedback Learning Engine

Build a light orchestration system that:
- Aggregates feedback by type, source, frequency, and affected module
- Assigns feedback to relevant systems: matching, search, metadata, reco
- Tracks resolution rate and latency (how fast issues are acted upon)

### ✅ Example Signal Map:
```
if feedback.type == 'spec error' and source == 'retail':
    → route to metadata_engine
if feedback.type == 'match false positive':
    → retrain matcher on updated sample
if feedback.type == 'query result bounce':
    → log query-product pair as low-confidence
```

## 5. 📊 Monitoring & Reporting

| Metric                        | What It Tells You                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feedback Volume / Week       | Raw engagement with the correction system                   |
| Resolution Time (avg/p95)    | Efficiency of issue triage and fix loop                     |
| Top Feedback Types           | Which parts of the system break most often                  |
| System Improvement Metrics   | % reduction in false matches, failed searches, bad recos    |

### ✅ Example Metrics:
- Avg resolution time: 2.4 days
- Feedback volume: 1200/week
- Top issues: Incorrect specs (40%), Reco irrelevance (25%), Match misses (15%)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                     | Mitigation Approach                                   |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Feedback overload                        | Prioritize by impact + frequency                      |
| Unstructured or vague comments           | Use annotation templates and controlled vocabularies |
| Feedback ignored due to unclear routing  | Feedback engine routes directly to system owners      |
| Fatigue from repeated corrections        | Close loop with visibility → show impact of input     |

## ✅ Outcome

Feedback turns catalog systems from static pipelines into **adaptive organisms**. Every correction, if used well, is an investment in future accuracy.
