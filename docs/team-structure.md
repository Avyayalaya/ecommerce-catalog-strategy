# 🧠 Technical Team Structure for Scalable Catalog Systems

To build scalable, intelligent, and self-improving catalog systems, you need more than just engineers or data scientists—you need a **precision-aligned team** with high agency, deep ownership, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

This document outlines how to design, hire for, and sustain a high-performance catalog systems team.

## 1. 🏗️ Core Roles and Their Interlocks

| Role                  | Focus Area                                             | Key Outputs                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Data Engineer         | Data pipelines, ingestion, cleaning, flattening       | Structured datasets, ETL jobs, lake schemas  |
| ML Engineer           | Matching, scoring, metadata inference                 | Models, features, embeddings, confidence scores |
| SDE (Backend)         | APIs, job orchestration, matching infra               | Low-latency, scalable backend pipelines       |
| Technical PM          | Systems thinking, roadmap alignment, stakeholder interface | Process specs, sprint plans, decision docs |
| Program Manager       | Delivery ops, velocity tracking, coordination across pods | Execution plans, cross-pod rhythms          |

> 🧠 **Note**: The team operates as a single pod with rotating problem statements and shared success metrics.

## 2. 🎯 How to Hire for This Team

### What to Look For:
| Attribute                 | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meta-skills              | Structured thinking, problem decomposition, learning agility               |
| Systems mindset          | Understands downstream and upstream impact of decisions                    |
| Agency                   | Takes initiative without waiting for full clarity                          |
| Writing & Communication  | Can document logic crisply and present to business stakeholders            |
| Curiosity + Pragmatism   | Eager to dive deep into new areas but knows when to stop overthinking      |

### Sample Interview Prompts
- “Design a feedback loop system for a catalog that scales with input volume.”
- “Given a failing match rate on a category, how would you triage?”
- “Show me how you’ve taken ambiguous requirements and turned them into a scalable solution.”

## 3. 🤝 Aligning Across Disciplines

Cross-functional doesn't mean everyone doing everything—it means designing **intentional intersections**:

### Weekly Rituals
| Meeting Type           | Purpose                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Catalog Systems Sync   | Share blockers, reinforce common priorities   |
| Reco/Search Handoff    | Align inference models with downstream needs  |
| Retail Feedback Forum  | Close the loop on overrides + edge cases      |

### Shared Metrics
- % increase in tail selection coverage
- Reduction in override rate by team
- Time-to-resolve for feedback loops
- Success rate of automated matches

> 🧭 Common goals ensure a Data Engineer knows why an override UI must work seamlessly—and a PM sees why a matching model needs latency tuning.

## 4. 🔄 Growth and Role Evolution

Design roles so that they can evolve into adjacent areas:
- Data Engineers → Infra leads or analytics partners
- ML Engineers → Product scientists or match architecture leads
- PMs → Category-facing leaders or systems designers
- Program Managers → Cross-pod orchestration or strategic planning roles

Encourage **project rotation every 2–3 quarters** to develop range and build deeper ownership.

---

## 5. 🧪 Culture of Hypothesis + Rigor

Cultivate:
- Proposals before coding
- Postmortems after failed launches
- Metrics instrumentation as a default, not a request

> “We don’t guess. We hypothesize. Then we validate.”

---

## ✅ Outcome

A high-agency, cross-functional team that:
- Moves fast without losing integrity
- Ships with clarity
- Thinks in feedback loops
- Measures what matters

> “Execution is horizontal. This team is designed to keep it that way.”
